Extracts from the 'usort' library by Andrew I. Schein
=====================================================

This directory contains a few modified extracts from the
[usort](https://bitbucket.org/ais/usort/overview) library written by Andrew I.
Schein and is used and distributed under the license described in
[`LICENSE`](./license).

Specifically, the routine for sorting arrays of unsigned chars has been adapted
to accept integers (whose values range from 0 to 255 inclusive). The code has
also been modified to compile under Microsoft's terrible C compiler.
